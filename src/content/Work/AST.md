## AST Guardian

A project I worked on while interning at [```Arima Labs```](https://arimalabs.in/) as a Python Developer. This project works with the following :

- Vehicle entry and exit detection (open-CV/open-VINO)
- Number plate text extraction (OCR)
- Video hosting/masking (Flask/ngrok)
- Sending live link to client (FAST2SMS)
