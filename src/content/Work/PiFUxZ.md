Textured - 3D model generation using a single 2D image. I built this while I was interning over at [```vInnovate Technologies```](https://vinnovatetechnologies.com/) as a Computer Vision Expert. Exisiting projects from Facebook like PiFu is able to generate 3D models with one image and PiFuHD is able to generate textured models using multiple images. PiFuxZ is best of both worlds.
